module Organizer
  # The LectureOrganizerBacktrackService class is designed to organize a set of lectures into
  # a conference schedule with multiple tracks. Each track has a morning and an afternoon session,
  # and there's a defined start and end time for each session. The goal is to find an optimal
  # schedule that minimizes the unused time in each session.
  #
  # Example Usage:
  #   schedule = LectureOrganizerBacktrackService.organize(lectures)
  #
